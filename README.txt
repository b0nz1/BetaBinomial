program outputs two plots:
1. Probability mass function of N samples.
2. Histogram of N samples according to the Beta Binomial distribution.

set params of:
N - number of samples
alpha - parameter of Beta
beta - parameter of Beta

p.s. I hope i understood correctly what i was supposed to implement.
If not i would gladly try to fix/change it.
